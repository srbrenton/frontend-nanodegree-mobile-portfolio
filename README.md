Due to unforeseeable family issues I've slipped four months in completing this project.
This submission is still not complete, but I need some feedback on how close I am.
I see that I've got 92/100 on the desktop page speed evaluation.
Since May I've had a steep learning curve on devTools,
especially since I was trying to follow the lessons with Canary Chrome.
The changes in main.js and style.css are mine without consulting whatever hints
may or may not be in the discussion forums.  Of course the `gimme' for changing the pizza sizes came from the lesson videos.
During the last four months I've attended a number of the webcasts.
I've tried to install and use the `gulp' stuff but that is a dead end for now node/npm/gulp conflicts.
So there won't be any minifications. It like main.js runs near or at 60 FPS for the basic pipeline,
but I don't understand the long frames or the greyed/empty extensions of the frame views in devTools
which reflect the compositor work.  I don't understand if the `long' frames should be or can be fixed.
Use the gh-pages branch on the github link to see my modifications.

Use github IO to see and test/measure the pizzas.

Thanks for any guidance you can give me.
