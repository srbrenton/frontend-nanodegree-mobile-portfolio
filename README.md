Okay this is an iterative submission.
This README and page speed modifications still need attention.

Went back to the lesson videos and quizes and some more ideas clicked.
The lessons sort of suggest transforms as being important.
Worked on merging my limited HTML5/CSS3 knowledge with the sine movement
and pretty much simplified the whole thing.
The transform call moved the placement of pizzas to the middle of the screen
and I worked around that as best I could.
I'd like to know if there is a way to confine the background pizzas to the moving red pizza background.
Maybe a new division, different layer (zindex ?)
And I went through and heeded may of the suggestions from the first review.


Due to unforeseeable family issues I've slipped four months in completing this project.
This submission is still not complete, but I need some feedback on how close I am.
I see that I've got 92/100 on the desktop page speed evaluation.
Since May I've had a steep learning curve on devTools,
especially since I was trying to follow the lessons with Canary Chrome.
The changes in main.js and style.css are mine without consulting whatever hints
may or may not be in the discussion forums.  Of course the 'gimme' for changing the pizza sizes came from the lesson videos.
During the last four months I've attended a number of the webcasts.
I've tried to install and use the 'gulp' stuff but that is a dead end for now due to node/npm/gulp conflicts.
So there won't be any minifications. It appears that main.js runs near or at 60 FPS for the basic pipeline,
but I don't understand the long frames or the greyed/empty extensions of the frame views in devTools
which reflect the compositor work.  I don't understand if the `long' frames should be or can be fixed.
Use the gh-pages branch on my github link to see my modifications.

Use github IO to see and test/measure the pizzas.

Thanks for any guidance you can give me.
